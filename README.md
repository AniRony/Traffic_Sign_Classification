# Traffic_Signal_Classification:: So here the main aim is to classify 43 different Road Traffic Signals or Traffic Signs by CNN, VGG16 amd VGG19 models. CNN being from scratch trained Model but other two are pretrained models on IMAGENET weights. Though all 3 are giving approximately same result. Vizaulation gives us a more clearer concept about the whole project. So the models are so good that it is recongizing signs almost 92%+ perfect even on the real test set. Even if you vizualise those plots which are giving failure in recognition those plots give us a clear idea that those images are literally not visible and recognizable even with our naked eyes.
